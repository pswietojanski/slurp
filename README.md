# SLURP: A Spoken Language Understanding Resource Package

This repository contains textual SLURP data and some additional resources allowing to replicate the results published in our [EMNLP 2020 paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.588.pdf). 

## Getting the data

1. Textual annotations are part of this repository and can be found under `dataset/slurp/` directory
2. To download the corresponding acoustic data, run `scripts/download_audio.sh` script (need around 6GB of disk space). Data is kindly hosted by [Zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/record/4274930) - an open science sharing platform.

## Further results

Please feel free to get in touch if you obtain any interesting results on SLURP (and they are publicly available, either as a paper or some other form like blogs, etc.). We are happy to link to them from here.

1. SLURP has now an end-to-end [recipe](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/main/recipes/SLURP) in [SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io/) toolkit. 
2. SLURP has now an end-to-end recipe in [ESPNet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) toolkit. See the corresponding paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14706.pdf).

## Brief overview

1. Each SLURP entry has the following structure. It contains NLU annotations and information allowing to link with audio files, as well as the corresponding metadata information. 
    * Note that `wer` (Word Error Rate) and `ent_wer` (Entity WER) fields for each recording were obtained automatically by scoring the ASR hypotheses against expected ground truths. In the paper we used all SLURP entries to train ASR systems (including ones where `wer>0`, but feel free to use this field to filter out less certain recordings.
    * Naming convention for audio files encodes close and distant microphones (`-headset` suffix denotes close-talk variant)

2. Each SLURP record (as above) has the corresponding metadata entry in `dataset/slurp/metadata.json`, providing more information on selected items. 
    * Many fields are for our internal use to link SLURP entries to raw database (can be igonored). 
    * Some, however, may be of use. For example, `usrid` field encodes speaker's gender and primary language (native / non-native). The encoding follows the pattern `GenderLanguage-Id`, where `Gender` could be either `F` (Female), `M` (Male) or `UNK` (Unknown). Language is either `E` (native English speaker) or `O` (native of Other langauge than English). `Id` is a uniq three-digit number, does not carry any meaningul information. As such `FE-488` is the recording uttered by a female participant whose English is a native language.
